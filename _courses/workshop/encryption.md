      ## Why Encryption?

      Encrypting a message allows us to hide the actual meaning from
      prying eyes while it's in transit.

      ## What is it?

      - **Encrypt the plaintext**
        (or file)
      - **Transfer the ciphertext**
      - **Decrypt the ciphertext**
      {: .flex-list }

      This process of encryption and decryption is what 
      we call an **encryption system**.

      ## Encryption Systems

      We use encryption systems all over the place!

      ## Caesar Cipher

      This is one of the most simple encryption methods.

      For every letter in your message, replace it with the letter
      five places further along in the alphabet.

      ## Caesar Challenge

      Decode the message

      ## Another Caesar Challenge

      This encrypted message uses a different shift amount.
      Can you still decipher it?
