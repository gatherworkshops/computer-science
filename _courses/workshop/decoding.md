    notes: |

      As a team, you will need to complete as many missions as possible in the time allocated.

      Missions have three levels of difficulty: green, orange and red.

      Each difficulty level will have code messages for semaphore, morse code, and binary.

      You will be able to choose the code type and the difficulty, but not the mission itself.

      Let's get started.

      ## Rules of the Game

      1. Only one recruit on mission at a time.
      2. Missions may only be read at the outpost.
      3. Each mission may only be completed once.
      4. A mission ends when the green flag is waved.

      ## Tools of the Game

      1. **Codebook:** Every recruit should have one.
      2. **Red Flag:** Signal outpost to repeat the mission.
      3. **Green Flag:** Signal outpost to return to base.

      ## Winning the Game

      The game may be won by either:

      - The first team to complete every mission correctly.
      - The team with the most points when time runs out.
